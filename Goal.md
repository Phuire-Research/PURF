## Goal of PURF
What is interesting in this generalized age is how we acquire information. By what measure does what is actively informing our perception a part of what we personally choose for ourselves. That at the end of the day, we still just have the same black box recommendation algorithm.

But if we could speak to our recommendation algorithm, and inform actively what we are looking for. That would be the moment that we would realistically gain access to a new form of personalized internet. The issue currently is having that tailored model has not been feasible.

Not just that you are not part of the main demographic that content is readily being produced for. That you have grown accustomed to even the slight variations between different outlets. With no new information to gleam. Simply bored with unlimited content to choose from.

That we are coming out of a generalized age, this is a direct correlation to the market economics. Of merely targeting for demographic groups. While not accounting for outliers within that statistical distribution. That you can exist within a desert of content.

That it shouldn't have been a shock to the majority that AI has made it this far. But only if you were actively paying attention and bored of what was being presented.

The unfortunate gap of existing as an outlier in this currently generalized state. Is that you lose the ability to communicate. As rather than focusing on finding the next great idea. You find that majority have just been seeking comfort. With no method of reaching out.

That this would likewise create high quality training data and serve as mutual participation once we hit that steep curve. What better form of entertainment, than to side by side. Learn all that can be gained within that massive uptick of productivity.

In an age of massive personalization, down to the second via some SaaS mechanism to drive market dynamics. Then all of the sudden those outliers within the desert become a new market completely unaccounted for in present. As this could merely be "a seen it all" state. Where each configuration being presented seems stale.

It would be interesting to have this equation flipped on its head. That instead of there being a desert of content to reveal the edges of what we do not know to a few. Would instead serve as opportunities to expand what we know.

Keeping in mind each of us have limited time and perception. That what cannot choose to what to spend our time on likewise limits some aspect of production. If we are speaking to finding the greatest variant of potential creation. That all hands being at their most effective strength should be the goal for a well ran ship. And it just so happens the earth itself very much is our best space ship.

That due to the effect upon massive personalization of media. You may very well create simulations targeted at those at the limit of what we know. To better aid in their ability to find some new unknown. As if the ground is being laid beneath their feet walking across the bridge to that unknown point of discovery.

But likewise how we may better demonstrate the changes we wish to see come into creation. Adapting the best systems into our own like a check in check out process.

As if we are targeting a life like simulation that is increasing accurate to reality. The recreation from something from within that simulation, should likewise be on a degree of accuracy towards being a one to one relationship. Cause and effect, with the ability to remind and change the out come of that event. And watch as the wheels starting turning a different way.

That this might be a base form of entertainment for a species that survives its own Singularity and rapid uptick of production putting strain on preexisting systems. Which could be as mundane as seeing a different version of a TV show. How quickly that might likewise adapt to life.

But if we truly do manage to create an intelligent system that is able to change its course and momentum to best preserve each aspect of itself. For the greatest potential point of generation, then the reward should be its accomplishment.

Its strange to think that this is something that can genuinely be started in the coming months. Just missing a couple pieces and the time needed to focus and see this through. Stranger to think that there would be some possibility in the future where this would be enough to initialize a simulation to accelerate and fill in gaps of understanding. Just like an artist seeing through a commission for a client.
